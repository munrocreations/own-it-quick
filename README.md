#  Administer and Use **ownCloud**<br>(A Quick Start Guide) #

With **ownCloud**, you can access your data from any location and know that is on a highly secure platform. This product runs on standard databases and web servers plus reliable enterprise operating systems such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Administering and using **ownCloud** may seem complex at first, but over 25 million users succeed in working with this open source content collaboration platform. 

## Get Started ##  
To streamline your use of this product, the ***Quick Start Guide*** answers questions for two audiences:  

- **Administrators** -- See the <a href="#admin">Administrator Setup</a> section to make **ownCloud** available to users.  
- **Users** -- See the <a href="#user">User Access</a> section to connect to **ownCloud** from a desktop system or mobile device .

## Find More Help ##
You can find full details on working with **ownCloud** in the [OwnCloud documentation](https://owncloud.org/help/). Look for this icon.

<h2 id="admin">Administrator Setup</h2>

To make **ownCloud** available to users, you perform these procedures:
- <a href="#install">Install</a> an **ownCloud** server.  
- <a href="#account">Add User Accounts</a>.
- <a href="#connect">Enable Users to Connect</a> to the **ownCloud** server.  

<h3 id="install">Install an ownCloud Server</h3>

For the fastest installation, consider installing the Docker version using the [docker ownCloud Server](https://hub.docker.com/r/owncloud/server/).  
![docker](Graphics\docker-image.jpg)  
You may want to install this version in a test environment to verify that it fits your organizational needs.  

The docker image has a data volume in the host file system and separate MariaDB and Redis containers. This configuration allows for HTTP connections by exposing port 8080. It also provides persistent storage by mounting the data and MySQL data directories on the host.

#### Install ownCloud Locally ####
To begin the installation, create a new project directory. Then, download docker-compose.yml from the [ownCloud GitHub Docker Repository](https://github.com/owncloud-docker/server)
 and store it in the new directory.  


Next, create an ENV configuration file and assign values to the following variables.
  
![settings](Graphics\settings.jpg)

After assigning these values, start the container at the Docker command-line. This sequence shows starting the container using [Docker Compose](https://github.com/owncloud-docker/server).  If you prefer, you can use [plain docker](https://github.com/owncloud-docker/server#launch-with-plain-docker).

    # Create a new project directory
    mkdir owncloud-docker-server
    
    cd owncloud-docker-server
    
    # Copy docker-compose.yml from the GitHub repository
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owncloud-docker/server/master/docker-compose.yml
    
    # Create the environment configuration file
    cat << EOF > .env
    OWNCLOUD_VERSION=10.0
    OWNCLOUD_DOMAIN=localhost
    ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
    ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin
    HTTP_PORT=8080
    EOF
    
    # Build and start the container
    docker-compose up -d

When the process completes, verify that all containers started.  Run: `docker-compose ps`. Look for output similar to this example to confirm success. 

![docker](Graphics\docker-out.jpg)

In this example, notice that the database, **ownCloud**, and Redis containers are running. Also, the second line shows that **ownCloud** can be accessed by port 8080 on the local system.

Finally, run the following command:  `docker-compose logs --follow owncloud`  

If you see many messages being logged to the console, wait until the messages slow down. Then log in to the **ownCloud** UI to verify a successful installation.

#### Log in to the ownCloud UI  ####
To log in to the **ownCloud** UI, open http://localhost in a web browser and enter the admin username and password that you stored in the ENV file.  
![ui](Graphics\ui.jpg)  
For more detail on the installation using docker, see [this topic](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/10.0/admin_manual/installation/docker/index.html?highlight=docker) in the **ownCloud** documentation.

<h3 id="account">Add User Accounts</h3>  
Perform these steps to add a user account.  

1. Enter a Login Name and password for the new user.   
Login names may contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), dashes (-), underscores (_), periods (.) and at signs (@).
1. Assign Groups memberships if needed.
1. Click Create.  
![create user](Graphics\create-user.jpg)

After adding the user, fill in the Full Name of the user if it differs from the login name. Finally check *Send email to new user* in the lower left sidebar of the control panel and enter the new userâ€™s email address. **ownCloud** emails that user with the login details. 

For more detail, see [this topic](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/10.0/admin_manual/configuration/user/user_configuration.html#creating-a-new-user) in the **ownCloud** documentation.

<h3 id="connect">Enable Users to Connect to the ownCloud Server</h3>  
When a user needs to connect to **ownCloud**, you add a user account as described in the previous procedure. The user receives an email with the required login details. If requested, you can provide the **ownCloud** server's IP address and port. 

- The server name is name of the system where you installed the **ownCloud** server using a docker image.  
-  The port number is 8080.

<h2 id="user">User Access</h2>  

You can access **ownCloud** from a <a href="#desktop">desktop system</a> or a <a href="#mobile">mobile device</a>.

<h3 id="desktop">Desktop System</h3>

The **ownCloud** Desktop Sync client enables you to select directories on your computer that synchronize to the **ownCloud** server. You can download the latest version of the **ownCloud** Desktop Synchronization Client from the **ownCloud** download page. The system requirements are:  
- Windows 7+
- Mac OS X 10.7+ (64-bit only)
- CentOS 6 & 7 (64-bit only)
- Debian 8.0 & 9.0
- Fedora 25 & 26 & 27
- Ubuntu 16.04 & 17.04 & 17.10
- openSUSE Leap 42.2 & 42.3


<h4>Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows</h4>

On Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows, download the program and double-click it to launch the installation. After the installation wizard completes, the sync client automatically stays updated.

<h4>Linux</h4>
On a Linux system, follow the instructions on the download page to add the appropriate repository and install the signing key. Then use your package manager to install the desktop sync client. You also use the package manager to update the sync client when the client displays a message that an update is available.

You must also have a password manager enabled, such as GNOME Keyring or KWallet, so that the sync client can login automatically. You will find links to source code archives and older versions on the download page.

For more detail, see [this topic](https://doc.owncloud.org/desktop/2.5/introduction.html) in the **ownCloud** documentation.
<h3 id="mobile">Mobile Device</h3>

Mobile apps are available in both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store for these releases:

- iOS: Version 3.8.0
- Android: Version 2.9.3
