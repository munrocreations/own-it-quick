#  Administer and Use **ownCloud**<br>(A Quick Start Guide) #

With **ownCloud**, you can access your data where you are and know that is on a highly secure platform. This product runs on standard databases and web servers plus reliable enterprise operating systems such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Administering and using **ownCloud** may seem complex at first, but over 25 million users succeed in working with this open source content collaboration platform. 

## Get Started ##  
To streamline your use of this product, the ***Quick Start Guide*** answers questions for two audiences:  

- **Administrators** -- See the <a href="#admin">Administrator Setup</a> section to make **ownCloud** available to users.  
- **Users** -- See the <a href="#user">User Access</a> section to connect to **ownCloud** from a desktop system or mobile device .  
> **Note**: For optimal use of this guide on a smart phone, turn the phone horizontally (landscape mode).

<h2 id="admin">Administrator Setup</h2>

To make **ownCloud** available to users, you perform these procedures:
- <a href="#install">Install</a> an ownCloud server.  
- <a href="#account">Add User Accounts</a>.
- <a href="#connect">Enable Users to Connect</a> to the ownCloud server.  

<h3 id="install">Install an ownCloud Server</h3>

If you are comfortable using docker, consider installing the docker version of the **ownCloud** Server. This version is the fastest installation option. You may want to install it in a test environment to verify that it fits your organizational needs.  

The docker image has a data volume in the host file system and separate MariaDB and Redis containers. This configuration allows for HTTP connections by exposing port 8080. It also provides persistent storage by mounting the data and MySQL data directories on the host.

#### Install ownCloud Locally ####
To begin the installation, create a new project directory. Then, download docker-compose.yml from the [ownCloud Docker GitHub repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/owncloud/server/) and store it in the new directory.  
![docker](Graphics\docker-image.jpg)

Next, create an ENV configuration file and assign values to the following variables.  
![settings](Graphics\settings.jpg)

After assigning these values, start the container at the Docker command-line. This sequence shows starting the container using [Docker Compose](https://hub.docker.com/r/owncloud/server/).  If you prefer, you can use [plain docker](https://github.com/owncloud-docker/server#launch-with-plain-docker).

    # Create a new project directory
    mkdir owncloud-docker-server
    
    cd owncloud-docker-server
    
    # Copy docker-compose.yml from the GitHub repository
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owncloud-docker/server/master/docker-compose.yml
    
    # Create the environment configuration file
    cat << EOF > .env
    OWNCLOUD_VERSION=10.0
    OWNCLOUD_DOMAIN=localhost
    ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
    ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin
    HTTP_PORT=8080
    EOF
    
    # Build and start the container
    docker-compose up -d

When the process completes, verify that all containers started.  Run: docker-compose ps. Look for output similar to this example to confirm success. 

![docker](Graphics\docker-out.jpg)

In this example, notice that the database, ownCloud, and Redis containers are running. Also, the second line shows that ownCloud can be accessed by port 8080 on the local system.

Finally, run the following command:  
    docker-compose logs --follow owncloud  

If you see many messages being logged to the console, wait until the messages slow down. Then log into the **ownCloud** UI to verify a successful installation.

#### Log into the ownCloud UI  ####
To log in to the **ownCloud** UI, open http://localhost in a web browser as shown here. Enter the admin username and password that you stored in ENV file.

For more detail on the installation using docker, see [this topic](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/10.0/admin_manual/installation/docker/index.html?highlight=docker) in the ownCloud documentation.

<h3 id="account">Add User Accounts</h3>  
Perform these steps to create a user.  

1. Enter a Login Name and password for the new user.   
Login names may contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), dashes (-), underscores (_), periods (.) and at signs (@).
1. Assign Groups memberships if needed
1. Click Create  
![create user](Graphics\create-user.jpg)

After creating the user, fill in the Full Name of the user if it differs from the login name. You could also ask the user to complete the Full Name.

Finally check *Send email to new user* in the lower left sidebar of the control panel and enter the new userâ€™s email address. **ownCloud** sends an email to notify that user about the details needed to log in. 

For more detail, see [this topic](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/10.0/admin_manual/configuration/user/user_configuration.html#creating-a-new-user) in the ownCloud documentation.

<h3 id="connect">Enable Users to Connect to the **ownCloud** Server</h3>  
When a user requires **ownCloud** access, you add a user account as described in the preceding procedure. The user receives an email with the required login details. 

In addition, you may need to provide the server's IP address and port. 

- The server name is name of the system where you installed the ownCloud server using a docker image.  
-  The port number is 8080.

Therefore, users supply the web URL in this format:  
    https://&lt;host-name&gt;:8080

<h2 id="user">ownCloud User Access</h2>  

You can access **ownCloud** from a <a href="#desktop">desktop system</a> or a <a href="#mobile">mobile device</a>.

<h3 id="desktop">Desktop</h3>

You can download the latest version of the **ownCloud** Desktop Synchronization Client from the **ownCloud** download page. The system requirements are:  

- Windows 7+
- Mac OS X 10.7+ (64-bit only)
- CentOS 6 & 7 (64-bit only)
- Debian 8.0 & 9.0
- Fedora 25 & 26 & 27
- Ubuntu 16.04 & 17.04 & 17.10
- openSUSE Leap 42.2 & 42.3


<h4>Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows</h4>

On Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows, download the program and double-click it to launch the installation. After the installation wizard completes, the sync client automatically stays updated.

<h4>Linux</h4>
On a Linux system, follow the instructions on the download page to add the appropriate repository and install the signing key. Then use your package manager to install the desktop sync client   and update your sync clients. The client displays a notification when an update is available.

You must also have a password manager enabled, such as GNOME Keyring or KWallet, so that the sync client can login automatically. You will find links to source code archives and older versions on the download page.

For more detail, see [this topic](https://doc.owncloud.org/desktop/2.5/introduction.html) in the ownCloud documentation.
